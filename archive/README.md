# Archive

This directory contains legacy code and approaches that have been superseded by our proven composition-based methods.

## Contents

### master_gene_pool/
**What it is**: Pre-analyzed LJPW profiles of real-world codebases (Django, Black, Requests)
- 31,851 Django functions analyzed
- Meant for selection-based code generation

**Why archived**:
- ❌ Not used by any proven experiments (Levels 1-6, Phase 2)
- ❌ Represents outdated paradigm (selection vs. composition)
- ❌ All breakthroughs came from composition, not selection
- See [GENE_POOL_ANALYSIS.md](../GENE_POOL_ANALYSIS.md) for full analysis

**Replaced by**: Mathematical composition theory with infinite design space

### master_grower.py
**What it is**: Original DNA-based code grower using gene pool selection
- Used archetype files as templates
- Required gene pool for profile matching

**Why archived**:
- ❌ Only user of master_gene_pool (which is archived)
- ❌ Not validated experimentally
- ❌ Selection-based approach proven inferior to composition

**Replaced by**: Fractal composition experiments (Levels 1-6) and Phase 2 autopoietic systems

## The Evolution

Our approach evolved through three paradigms:

1. **Selection** (Archived) - "Find examples and copy patterns"
   - Gene pool approach
   - Template-based
   - Limited by what exists

2. **Composition** (Phase 1) - "Define mathematically and compose fractally"
   - Proven across 6 abstraction levels
   - Infinite design space
   - Predictable LJPW profiles

3. **Emergence** (Phase 2) - "Create conditions, allow autopoiesis"
   - Intent is measurable
   - Systems self-sustain
   - The Orchid Principle

## Should I Use This Code?

**No.** Use the proven approaches instead:

- **For fractal composition**: See `experiments/` (Levels 1-6)
- **For autopoietic systems**: See `experiments/phase2/`
- **For composition theory**: See `composition_theory.py` (now in phase2/)

## Historical Value

This archive preserves our learning journey:
- Shows evolution from selection to composition
- Documents dead ends and why they didn't work
- Provides real-world LJPW data for research

**The Orchid Principle**:
> "You don't catalog existing orchids (gene pool).
> You create conditions for new ones (composition theory)."
