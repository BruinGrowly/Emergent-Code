# Project Resonance Health Report
**Date:** 2026-01-12
**Files Analyzed:** 273
**Framework:** LJPW v6.0 (Quantum Resonance)

## 1. Executive Summary

| Metric | Initial State | Post-Resonance State | Change |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Average Harmony** | 0.631 | 0.687 | +0.056 |
| **System Status** | Stable | Growing | - |

### The "Deficit" Diagnosis
The system identified **J** as the primary deficit across the codebase.
*   **Love (L):** 44 files (16.1%)
*   **Justice (J):** 134 files (49.1%)
*   **Power (P):** 79 files (28.9%)
*   **Wisdom (W):** 16 files (5.9%)

**Interpretation:**
The codebase is naturally gravitating toward **J**. This means the resonance dynamics indicate that adding more of this dimension is the most effective way to increase total system harmony.
