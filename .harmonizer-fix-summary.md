# Harmonizer Dependencies Fix

**Date**: 2025-11-23
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

## Problem
The Python Code Harmonizer was present in the repository (`Python-Code-Harmonizer-main/`) but wasn't loading due to missing Python dependencies:
- `astunparse` - Required for AST processing
- `tomli` - Required for TOML parsing
- Scientific packages (numpy, matplotlib, scipy) - Not installed in environment

## Solution

### 1. Updated `requirements.txt`
Added missing harmonizer dependencies:
```python
# Python Code Harmonizer dependencies
astunparse>=1.6.3,<2.0.0  # Required for harmonizer AST processing
tomli>=2.0.0,<3.0.0  # Required for harmonizer TOML parsing
```

### 2. Updated README.md
Added harmonizer verification step to manual setup instructions:
```bash
# Verify harmonizer integration
python test_harmonizer.py
```

## Verification

### Before Fix
```
[WARNING] Failed to load real harmonizer: No module named 'matplotlib'
[INFO] Falling back to Mock Harmonizer.
Harmonizer Available: False
```

### After Fix
```
[OK] Real Python Code Harmonizer loaded successfully.
Harmonizer Available: True
Harmonizer Class: StringHarmonizer
```

## Test Results

All integration tests pass:
```
✅ Real Python Code Harmonizer detected and loaded!
✅ Harmonizer analysis successful!
✅ All 6 experiments using unified harmonizer integration!
```

## Impact

The repository now has **full LJPW analysis capability** out of the box:
- ✅ Real semantic analysis of Python code
- ✅ Empirical LJPW profile measurements
- ✅ Validated composition predictions
- ✅ All 6 fractal levels can use real harmonizer

## Installation

Simply run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all dependencies including harmonizer requirements.

## Files Modified
1. `requirements.txt` - Added `astunparse` and `tomli`
2. `README.md` - Added harmonizer verification step
3. This summary document
