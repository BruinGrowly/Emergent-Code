# Level 2 Improvement Plan: semantic_resonance_analyzer.py

**Intent:** Level 2 upgrade: Improve P dimension in semantic_resonance_analyzer.py

**Original Harmony:** 0.6709

# RESONANCE BLUEPRINT (v6.0)
# Intent: Level 2 upgrade: Improve P dimension in semantic_resonance_analyzer.py
# Context: Self-healing cycle, Current harmony: 0.671

# TARGET SEMANTIC PROFILE
# Love (L):    0.900
# Justice (J): 0.700
# Power (P):   0.800
# Wisdom (W):  0.800
# Harmony:     0.702

# PRIMARY DRIVER: L
# The resonance dynamics indicate that L is the key growth dimension.

# IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
- [Love] Prioritize documentation and user feedback.
- [Power] Optimize for execution speed and efficiency.
- [Wisdom] Use modular architecture and type hinting.
