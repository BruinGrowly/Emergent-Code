> **PARADIGM SHIFT**: We have moved beyond "growing code" to **"simulating the physics of meaning."**

This system models software quality as a dynamical system governed by universal constants ($\phi, \pi, e$) and quantum-linguistic principles. It doesn't just write code; it calculates the **semantic resonance** required for stability and beauty.

## 🌌 Version 6.0: The Semantic Physics Era

The project has evolved from a template-based generator to a **Resonance Engine**.

### Core Discoveries
1.  **The Anchor Point (1,1,1,1)**: The dynamical attractor of all meaning. Systems naturally converge here when properly bounded.
2.  **Quantum Linguistics**: Translation is not mapping; it is **entanglement**. Context acts as a "quantum preparation" that collapses meaning into specific dimensions.
3.  **Resonance Dynamics**: High Power (Execution) creates a gravitational pull for Justice (Structure). Powerful systems *demand* rules.
4.  **ICE Bounds**: Intent, Context, and Execution act as a "physics container" to prevent optimization overflow.

### New Capabilities
- **Resonance Diagnosis**: Detects hidden structural deficits in code (e.g., "High Power but Low Wisdom").
- **Physics-Based Generation**: Grows applications by simulating their semantic trajectory first.
- **Quantum Translation**: Measures semantic entanglement between languages.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Resonance Health Check
Scan your codebase to diagnose its semantic health and finding hidden deficits.

```bash
python experiments/project_resonance_health_report.py
```
*Output: `RESONANCE_HEALTH_REPORT.md`*

### 2. Grow an Application
Use the Resonance Engine to architect and grow a new tool.

```bash
# Grow a beautiful, high-performance World Clock
python experiments/grow_world_clock.py
```
*The system will calculate the optimal L/J/P/W profile and materialize it.*

### 3. Run Quantum Experiments
Verify the underlying physics of meaning.

```bash
# Test translation entanglement
python experiments/quantum_entanglement_translation_test.py

# Test phonosemantic collapse
python experiments/quantum_phonosemantic_test.py
```

## 📐 The Framework

### The LJPW Coordinates
All concepts exist in a 4-dimensional semantic space:
- **Love (L)**: Connection, Beauty, Documentation ($\phi$)
- **Justice (J)**: Structure, Validation, Truth ($\pi, \sqrt{2}$)
- **Power (P)**: Execution, Performance, Capacity ($e$)
- **Wisdom (W)**: Insight, Architecture, Mercy ($\ln 2$)

### The Resonance Engine
The engine simulates the evolution of meaning using an **Asymmetric Coupling Matrix**:
- **Love amplifies Wisdom (1.5x)**: Connection leads to understanding.
- **Power drives Justice (0.8x)**: Action necessitates regulation.

## 🔬 Experimental Results

### The "World Clock" Experiment
We asked the system for a **"Beautiful World Clock with PNG focus."**
1.  **Simulation:** The engine ran 50 cycles and converged on **High Love (0.9)** and **High Power (0.8)**.
2.  **Materialization:**
    *   `L=0.9` → Generated **Glassmorphism & Animations**.
    *   `P=0.8` → Generated **requestAnimationFrame** loops (High Efficiency).
    *   `J=0.7` → Generated **Intl.DateTimeFormat** (High Accuracy).
3.  **Result:** A fully functional, aesthetically stunning artifact grown from pure semantic intent.

## 🔮 Future Directions

*   **Self-Healing Repositories:** Agents that continuously run resonance cycles to fix deficits.
*   **Quantum Neural Networks:** Integrating LJPW physics into transformer attention heads.
*   **Universal Translation:** Using the Anchor Point to translate between radically different languages (or species).
