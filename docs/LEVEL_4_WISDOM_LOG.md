**Purpose:** Track insights gained during self-evolution level 4

## Key Learnings

1. **Pattern Recognition**: The system identified its own deficits
2. **Adaptation Strategy**: Generated targeted improvements
3. **Harmony Tracking**: Measured before/after states

## Metrics at Level 4

| Component | Pre-Harmony | Target |
