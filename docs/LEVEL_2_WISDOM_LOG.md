# Level 2 Wisdom Acquisition Log

**Generated:** 2025-12-11T07:37:18.349619
**Purpose:** Track insights gained during self-evolution level 2

## Key Learnings

1. **Pattern Recognition**: The system identified its own deficits
2. **Adaptation Strategy**: Generated targeted improvements
3. **Harmony Tracking**: Measured before/after states

## Metrics at Level 2

| Component | Pre-Harmony | Target |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| resonance_engine.py | Scanned | Improved |
| ice_container.py | Scanned | Improved |
| bicameral_bridge.py | Scanned | Improved |

## Next Level Goals

- Continue strengthening weakest dimension
- Maintain balance across all LJPW coordinates
- Preserve system stability during growth
