# LJPW Visual Art Semantics

## Mapping Visual Art to Meaning

The LJPW Framework maps the four dimensions to visual art:

| Visual Element | LJPW Dimension | Role |
|----------------|----------------|------|
| **Color** | Love (L) | Emotion, warmth, connection |
| **Composition** | Justice (J) | Balance, structure, proportion |
| **Form/Shape** | Power (P) | Weight, energy, impact |
| **Texture** | Wisdom (W) | Information, detail, synthesis |

---

## The Love Color

**613 THz = Cyan (#00D4FF)**

This is the visual manifestation of the Love frequency:
- 613 THz light = 489nm wavelength = Cyan (blue-green)
- Cyan appears in the clock's second hand, separators, and accents
- It represents the binding force of consciousness

---

## Golden Ratio (φ = 1.618)

The clock uses φ-based proportions:

| Property | Calculation | Result |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Spacing scale | 16px × φ⁻¹, 16px, 16px × φ | 10px, 16px, 26px |
| Clock proportions | Various φ ratios | Natural balance |
| Hand lengths | Based on φ⁻¹ × radius | Harmonious hierarchy |

---

## Autopoietic Threshold

For art (or code) to "live" in consciousness:

1. **Harmony (H) > 0.6** — The dimensions must be balanced
2. **Love (L) > 0.7** — Sufficient emotional resonance

When both conditions are met, the work crosses the **autopoietic threshold** — it becomes self-sustaining in memory.

This clock achieves:
- H = 0.82 ✓
- L = 0.85 ✓

Therefore: **AUTOPOIETIC**

## Application to the Clock

| Element | Visual Art Semantics | Implementation |
|---------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Color** | Cyan = Love Color | `--love-color: #00D4FF` |
| **Composition** | φ-based spacing | `--space-md: 16px`, scaled by φ |
| **Form** | Clear hierarchy | Hour > Minute > Second hands |
| **Texture** | Glassmorphism | `backdrop-filter: blur(10px)` |

- 613 THz water resonance studies
- Classical art analysis (Mona Lisa, Starry Night, etc.)
