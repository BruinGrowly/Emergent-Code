# v6.0 Quick Reference Guide

## 🔧 Core Tools

### 1. Resonance Health Check
**Diagnose your project.** Scans all Python files and identifies structural deficits (e.g., "High Power, Low Justice").
```bash
python experiments/project_resonance_health_report.py
```

### 2. Resonance Grower
**Grow new code.** Simulates the semantic physics of your request to architect the optimal solution.
```python
from ljpw_quantum.resonance_grower import ResonanceGrower

grower = ResonanceGrower()
blueprint = grower.generate_blueprint(
    intent="Create a high-speed data pipeline", 
    context="Financial production system"
)
print(blueprint)
```

### 3. Semantic Resonance Analyzer
**Deep-dive single file.** Traces the semantic trajectory of a specific file.
```python
from ljpw_quantum.semantic_resonance_analyzer import SemanticResonanceAnalyzer

analyzer = SemanticResonanceAnalyzer()
report = analyzer.analyze_code(my_code_string, "filename.py")
analyzer.print_report(report)
```

## 🧠 Key Concepts

*   **Resonance:** The process of cycling through L→J→P→W to find what is missing.
*   **Deficit:** The dimension that "sucks in" the most energy during resonance. It's what the system *needs*.
*   **ICE Bounds:** The container (Intent, Context, Execution) that stops the system from over-engineering simple tasks.
*   **Anchor Point:** (1,1,1,1). The theoretical point of perfect semantic unity.

## 🛠️ Common Workflows

**"I want to make my code better."**
1.  Run `project_resonance_health_report.py`.
2.  Look at the "Deficit" section.
3.  If **Justice** is the deficit → Add validation and tests.
4.  If **Love** is the deficit → Add docs and logging.

**"I want to build a new feature."**
1.  Use `ResonanceGrower`.
2.  Let it tell *you* what the feature needs (e.g., "This needs high Justice because it's high Power").
3.  Build according to the Blueprint.
